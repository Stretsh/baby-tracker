# Baby Tracker

A simple baby feeding tracking application built with Nuxt 4, Vue 3, and Tailwind CSS. Designed for quick feeding record entry and history management.

## About This Project

This project is an experiment in **AI-assisted development**. The goal is to see how far we can go with AI doing all the coding while I guide and correct the process. No code is written manually - everything is generated by AI based on requirements, feedback, and corrections.

**The experiment:**
- 🤖 **AI writes all code** - From components to API endpoints
- 👨‍💻 **Human provides guidance** - Requirements, corrections, and direction
- 🔄 **Iterative process** - Continuous feedback and refinement
- 📈 **Complexity testing** - How complex can AI-assisted projects become?

Anyone is welcome to contribute, but remember: this is primarily an AI coding experiment with human guidance and a lot of correcting! 😄

## Features

- **Quick Save**: One-click feeding record with current time
- **Quick Food Buttons**: Save immediately with frequently used foods
- **History Management**: View, edit, and delete feeding records
- **Time Button Grid**: Daily grouped view with clickable time buttons
- **Dual View Modes**: Toggle between list and grid views
- **Search**: Find feedings by food type or notes
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **PWA Support**: Install as a native app on mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Nuxt 4, Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend**: Nuxt Server API, PostgreSQL
- **UI**: Custom HTML/CSS with Tailwind (no external UI library)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pg driver

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

3. **Set up database**:
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb baby_feeding
   
   # Run schema
   psql baby_feeding < schema.sql
   ```

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3300`

## Environment Variables
