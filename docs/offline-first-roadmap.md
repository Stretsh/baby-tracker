# Offline-First Baby Tracker Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
Transform the current PWA into a robust offline-first application with local-first data storage, background sync, and conflict resolution.

## üéØ Current Progress
**Status**: Phase 2 Mostly Complete - Offline-First CRUD Working, Sync Queuing Ready

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- **Offline-First Data Layer**: Complete Dexie.js implementation with local storage
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete all work offline
- **Automatic Sync Queuing**: All changes are queued for background sync
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation with proper error handling
- **Component Integration**: All components now use offline-first operations
- **Migration Infrastructure**: Server endpoints ready for data migration (planned)

### üîÑ Current Capabilities
- **Quick Save**: Works offline with just timestamp
- **Food Buttons**: Save with specific food types offline
- **History View**: Loads from local database
- **Edit/Delete**: All operations work completely offline
- **Data Persistence**: All data stored in IndexedDB
- **Sync Queuing**: Changes automatically queued for background sync

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
- **No Server Sync**: Data is NOT syncing to server database yet
- **No Background Sync**: Sync queue exists but no processing yet
- **No Migration**: Existing server data not migrated to client_id format
- **No Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts detected but no resolution UI

### üìã Next Steps
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced Service Worker (offline indicators, request queuing)
- **Phase 4**: Sync Engine (two-way sync, conflict resolution)
- **Phase 5**: Server API Updates (client_id support, conflict detection)

- Phase 5 must complete before Phase 6 (sync needs server API)
- Phase 3 can run parallel to Phase 2 (service worker independent)

### **High-Risk Areas**
- **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss during client_id backfill
- **Sync Conflicts**: Complex conflict resolution logic
- **Service Worker**: Browser compatibility and caching issues
- **Performance**: Dexie.js performance with large datasets

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Data Migration**: Test with production data copy first
- **Sync Conflicts**: Implement comprehensive testing scenarios
- **Service Worker**: Test across multiple browsers and devices
